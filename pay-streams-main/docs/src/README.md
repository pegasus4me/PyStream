<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

PayStreams is a payment streaming service which allows anyone to open token streams directed to any recipient. The recipient can collect the streamed funds over time, or when the stream ends. The stream creator can update, pause, unpause, or cancel the stream as well. Streams can be one-time, or recurring.

Additionally, we introduce hooks, which are functions with custom logic that can be invoked at various points during the stream's lifespan. To opt into hooks, both the streamer and the recipient can set custom vaults with correct functions and hook configuration, and these functions will be invoked by the `PayStreams` contract when certain events occur. Hooks open up a wide array of use cases and customizations, enabling developers to extend the functionality of streams. You can find some hook examples in the `./src/exampleHooks/` folder.

P.S. This project was built for the BuildOn hackathon on Devfolio.
